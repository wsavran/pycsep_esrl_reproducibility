A reproducibility package contains the code and data needed to recreate figures from a published article (Krafczyk
et al., 2021). This reproducibility package provides an introduction to pyCSEP and acts as an example for future publications. We refer readers interested in creating their own reproducibility packages to Krafczyk et al. (2021).

We provide the user with options to download a _full_ or _lightweight_ version of the reproducibility package from Zenodo. The _full_ version of the package recreates Figs. 2â€’7 from the manuscript. The lightweight version omits Fig. 3 and Fig. 6, because they require a ~24Gb download for the UCERF3-ETAS forecast, which can take a while (~3h) depending on the connection to Zenodo. These figures also require the most computing time to recreate (see [Computational effort](#computational-effort)).

We recommend that users begin with the _lightweight_ version of the package for a quick introduction to pyCSEP and to use the
_full_ version to learn about evaluating catalog-based forecasts or working with UCERF3-ETAS forecasts. The package is configured to provide turn-key reproducibility of the published results. Users can also interact with scripts to individually recreate each figure.

## Instructions
If you have obtained the software from Zenodo, you may skip this step. Make sure that the file contents are extracted and navigate to the package directory.

If you are viewing this on GitHub or have not downloaded the code from Zenodo, open a terminal and download the reproducibility package from GitHub with
```
git clone https://github.com/wsavran/pycsep_esrl_reproducibility.git
```

Navigate to the newly downloaded directory
```
cd pycsep_esrl_reproducibility
```

### Run the computational environment

> Important: Use the Docker instructions to ensure the same computational environment as the publication. The `conda` instructions are useful for users that wish to extend the package or want to work with pyCSEP outside of this context.

Now you have two options how to run the package:
 * [Easy-mode using Docker](#easy-mode-using-docker)
 * [Using a conda environment](#using-a-conda-environment)

The easiest way to run the reproducibility package is to run the _lightweight_ version of the package in an environment provided
by Docker. If you are interested in working with pyCSEP in more detail, we recommend that you install pyCSEP in a `conda` environment in the native OS.

For both options we have accompanying scripts that work both under Linux/macOS or Windows.

#### Easy mode using Docker

You will need to have the Docker runtime environment installed and running on your machine. Some instructions
can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). The following commands will not work unless the Docker engine
is correctly installed on your machine.

If on Linux/maxOS, call in the Terminal/Console:
```
./run_all.sh
```
If on Windows, call in the Command Prompt/Powershell:
```
.\run_all.bat
```

This step does the following things: (1) download and verify the checksum of the downloaded
data; (2) build a docker image with the computational environment; and (3) run the reproducibility package.

To reproduce the _full_ version, call:
> ```
> ./run_all.sh --full
> ```
> or (if on Windows):
> ```
> .\run_all.bat --full
> ```

When finished, the results and figures will be stored in `./results` and `./figures`, respectively. These can be compared against the expected results that are found in the `expected_results` directory.

The `start_docker.sh` or `start_docker.bat` scripts provide an interactive terminal to re-create individual figures. See [below](#reproduce-figures-individually) for instructions.

> Note: For best performance on Windows 10/11, Docker should be used with the WSL2 backend instead
of the legacy Hyper-V backend---provided your hardware supports it. This can be configured in
Docker's Settings > General > 'Use the WSL 2 based engine'. For more information and how to enable the WSL2 feature
on your Windows 10/11, see [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl).

> Note: If you are running Docker on MacOS you might run into permission errors when trying to start (or run) the Docker container. To fix this, manually create the `figures` and `results` directories (eg `cd figures` and `cd results` and add these to the Docker host.)

#### Using a conda environment

Installation instructions can be found in the [pyCSEP documentation](https://docs.cseptesting.org/getting_started/installing.html). **Warning**: this method does not guarantee a stable computing environment, because `conda` provides the newest packages that are compatible with your environment. Please report any issues related to this [here](https://github.com/SCECcode/pycsep/issues).

Create and activate a new conda environment:
```
conda env create -n pycsep_esrl
conda activate pycsep_esrl
```

Install v0.5.2 of pyCSEP:
```
conda install --channel conda-forge pycsep=0.5.2
```

Download data from Zenodo:
```
./download_data.sh
```
or (if on Windows):
```
.\download_data.bat
```

> Note: to download the _'full'_ version, append ` --full` to the command (see [above](#easy-mode-using-docker))

Run the package to reproduce all figures from the manuscript that are supported by your downloaded version (_lightweight_ or _full_):
```
cd scripts
python plot_all.py
```

Once completed, the figures can be found in the `figures` directory in the top-level directory and results in the `results` directory. These can be compared against the expected results that are found in the `expected_results` directory.

To recreate individual figures, follow the instructions below.


## Reproduce figures individually

The scripts to reproduce the figures are contained in the `scripts` directory; change to it if you are in the top-level directory:
```
cd scripts
```
> Note: Any script must be launched from within this `scripts` directory.

Here is an example to recreate Fig. 2:
```
python plot_figure2.py
```

If you only downloaded the _lightweight_ version from Zenodo, you will be unable to run `plot_figure3.py` or `plot_figure6.py`.


## Code description

The top-level directory contains a few helpful scripts for working with the Docker environment. Descriptions of the files in the top-level directory are as follows (the `.sh` and `.bat` scripts provide the same functionality on different operating systems):

* `download_data.{sh|bat}`: downloads and verifies checksums of the data from Zenodo
* `build_docker.{sh|bat}`: (re)builds the Docker image for this environment
* `start_docker.{sh|bat}`: starts Docker container and provides command-line interface with pycsep environment active
* `run_docker.{sh|bat}`: runs the Docker container and automatically launches the package
* `entrypoint.sh`: entrypoint for the runnable Docker container

The code to execute the main experiment can be found in the `scripts` directory of this repository. The files are named
according to the figure they create in the manuscript. The script `plot_all.py` will generate all of the figures supported by the downloaded version.
Descriptions of the files in the `scripts` directory are as follows:

* `plot_all.py`: generates all figures listed below
* `plot_figure2.py`: plots RELM and Italian time-independent forecasts with the catalog used to evaluate the forecasts
* `plot_figure3.py`: plots selected catalogs from UCERF3-ETAS forecast (only in _full_ version)
* `plot_figure4.py`: plots S-test and N-test evaluations for RELM and Italian time-independent forecasts
* `plot_figure5.py`: plots t-test and W-test evaluations for RELM and Italian time-independent forecasts
* `plot_figure6.py`: plots S-test and N-test evaluations for UCERF3-ETAS forecasts (only in _full_ version)
* `plot_figure7.py`: illustrates plotting capabilities and manipulation of gridded forecasts
* `experiment_utilities.py`: functions and configuration needed to run the above scripts
* `download_data.py`: downloads data from Zenodo (see DOI link at the top)

## Software versions
* `python>=3.7`
* `pycsep=0.5.2`

To obtain the environment used for publishing this manuscript use [Docker](#easy-mode-using-docker). Advanced users can recreate the environment using `conda` running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Computational effort

On a recent (2021) laptop with a 4.6GHz Intel i7, the total runtimes on Windows were as follows:
 * _lightweight_ version in Docker and native OS: ~2min
 * _full_ version:
   * in Docker: ~1h 40min (~3h on a late 2017 MacBook Pro with a 2.9GHz Intel i7)
   * in native OS: ~1h 5min

The Docker environment introduces latency with I/O operations (only noticible when reading the catalog-based UCERF3-ETAS forecast file, and in some computing environments).
